# The fan makes noise or doesn't work.

Issues with the fan being noisy or not working are caused by loose mounting of the fan to the fan port.  

Firmly pressing down on the fan at all 4 corners should see the issue improve. Also, there is double-sided tape on the back of the fan. If you tear off its protective backing, and stick the fan back into the fan port, that should provide a more permanent fix for the vibration noise caused by the loose mounted fan.
