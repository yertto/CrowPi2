# Official CrowPi2 system image
The latest CrowPi2 system image is available [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kL1lQcXDQit4ITlbM5aiwib_8aIJ9ziC/view).  

***Note:** It's normal for your system to restart once, when booted for the first time, in order to expand the filesystem automatically.*  

<br>

# Initial Setup
Run the ***Raspberry Pi Setup Wizard***, it will guide you through the process.  
1. Press **Alt**+**F2**, a ***Run*** dialog box appears  
2. Type the following command, then press **Enter**. <br> `sudo piwiz`  
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup process.  
***Note:** For more details on the Raspberry Pi Setup Wizard, see [HERE](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspbian-update-june-2018/).*
