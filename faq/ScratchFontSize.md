# How to adjust the font size of the Scratch Desktop interface?

There are 3 major versions of the Scratch app, each use a different method to adjust the font size as lised below:  

### Scratch 1.4  

1. Press **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**T**, a new Terminal window appears.  
2. At the command prompt, type `nano ~/.scratch.ini` and press **Enter**.  
3. Add the line, `fontscale=1.3` (Try experiment with different values as desired).  
4. Press **Ctrl**+**X**, **Y** to save the changes and exit the nano text editor.  


### Scratch 2.0  

1. In the **Scratch Desktop**, hold-down **Shift** and click on the **Globe** icon.
2. Click on **set font size** and choose your desired font size (ex. 13).
***Note:** This set the font size of the Block Palette only.*


### Scratch 3.0  
Currently, there is no known method to adjust the font size. But there is a workaround available using Pixel Doubling, see [How to enable Pixel Doubling?](https://github.com/Pearl-852/CrowPi2/blob/main/faq/PixelDoubling.md#how-to-enable-pixel-doubling-for-a-high-resolution-monitor) for details.
