# How to enable Pixel Doubling for a high resolution monitor?

Pixel Doubling can make fonts more readable (larger) on a small screen with high resolution, however, there are drawbacks  

- The Crowpi2 software refuses to run, complaining that **The CrowPi2 software needs to run at 1920x1080 resolution!**.  
- Pixel Doubling affects the entire system. Enabling pixel doubling simply draws every pixel in the desktop as a 2Ã—2 block of pixels on the screen, making everything exactly twice the size and resulting in a more usable desktop. But this will sacrifice screen quality.  
- Will need more fiddling with other appearance settings to suit your own liking.  

### To enable Pixel Doubling:
1. Click on **Menu** (Raspberry icon).  
2. Select **Preferences** and choose **Raspberry Pi Configuration**.  
3. The ***Raspberry Pi Configuration*** window appears.
